# Overview

Ok, this is my second project from freecodecamp. I feel like this came out A LOT rougher than my first one and more plain as well.
Partly due to the fact I was trying my hand at moving things to side more when my first on was just centered.
If anything I feel like I learned a bit more about how margins work (kinda) though I'm still lost on how everthing interacts with eachother on the page.
To be honest I think it might look just as good or better without the css, or if anything just having the body be centered.

## The page breaks when shrunk at all

I'm not gonna even mark this as an actual issue on the repo cause I feel like it's just broken at its core and would need to be entirely rebuilt to fix.
But when using the devtools and seeing how it looks on moblie is...yikes, would probably look better with plain html. Though that doesn't really matter cause
this repo is the only way to view it anyhow. Avoiding that is a lesson for another day.
